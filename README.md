# File-Renamer (rename files using numbers)
A friend was naming the files manually using numbers as it is easier than having to think of a file name for each of the image files. For example, if there are 10 files then the first file will be 1.JPEG, the second 2.JPEG, up to 10.JPEG. However, it consumes more time as the number of images downloaded got larger.
So this program was made to help that friend who was manually naming image files.
